## Data and Project Goal 
Wisconsin is the nation's leading producer of cranberries, harvesting more than 60 percent of the country's crop. The dataset includes 1980-2020 cranberry growth and sales data in Wisconsin, Oregon, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. The project applied Excel to analyze and visualize cranberry business data for economic decisions. 

## 1. Trends over time in cranberry price and production
Figure 1 shows the cranberry price had 2 significant fluctuations between 1980 and 2020. From 1980, the cranberry price increased steady until the highest point $64/barrel in 1996. The price crashed down to lowest price $14 per barrel in 1999, then had sustained recovery, with $5 rise per year, back to the highest price in 2008. After 2008, the price was on a downward trend with 2 slight rises in 2012 and 2018. The price ended at $37/barrel in 2020, which had a small rise compared with $33/barrel in 1980.

Figure 2 shows the cranberry overall production increased steady with slight seesaws between 2007 and 2020. The cranberry production in Wisconsin had a clear uptrend, increased from 3.8 million barrels to 4.7 million barrels. The production in Massachusetts slightly rose from 1.5 million to 2 million. The New Jersey and Oregon production stabilized at 0.6 million barrels.

## 3. Cranberry producer productivity
Figure 4 shows Wisconsin producers have highest productivity. They can product more cranberries per acre. This may because they grow cranberries in large space. Figure 5 shows 69% cranberries in Wisconsin are grown in the space larger than 100 acres.

## 4. The relationship between production and price
Based on the average price and total production from 2007 to 2020, Figure 6 shows cranberry price has a negative relationship with total production. More cranberries are produced, price/barrel will be cheaper. The total revenue of cranberry from 2009 to 2020 stays around $300 million dollars with 2 slight fluctuations in 2012 and 2016.
